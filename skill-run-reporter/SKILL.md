# Skill Run Reporter

Check and report which skills ran on a given date, their execution status, and key metrics.

## Usage

```bash
python3 scripts/report.py --mymind-root /path/to/mymind [YYYYMMDD]
```

Default date is yesterday. Pass a date like `20260519` to check a specific day.

The script scans the selected mymind output directories and, when supplied by
the desktop app, structured RunStore records under `CCTOOLS_RUN_DIR`. It does
not read Skill installation directories, caches, logs or a cctools ancestor.

## What it checks

| Skill | Data Sources |
|-------|-------------|
| rss-article-saver | `article/YYYYMMDD/`, `.counter.json`, RunStore records |
| daily-article-summarizer | `daily-summary/YYYYMMDD_*.md`, RunStore records |
| x-following-fetcher | `post/YYYYMMDD/` |
| reddit-fetcher | `reddit/YYYYMMDD/`, RunStore records |
| daily-topic-selector | `daily-topic/YYYYMMDD_*.md` |
| knowledge-wiki-compiler | `wiki/_state/lint_report.md` timestamp |
| ai-media-topic-selector | `creative/` topic files with date |
| rss-to-summary-workflow | structured Workflow Run records |

## After running the script

Present the report to the user. If any skill shows issues (no output, errors in logs), highlight them. Summarize overall pipeline health in one sentence.
