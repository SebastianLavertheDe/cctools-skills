Desktop App contract: use `cctools.skill.yaml` as the runnable contract.
`curl.txt` and optional extra curl files are private credentials under
`OPENMIND_SKILL_DATA_DIR`; they are excluded from installed packages, parsed
as data by the Python HTTP client, and never executed as shell commands. The
`X_FETCHER_CREDENTIAL_JSON` environment variable remains available only for
explicit direct/test invocations. Caches and external-fetch logs also belong
to `OPENMIND_SKILL_DATA_DIR`.
